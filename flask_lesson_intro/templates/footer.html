                <h5 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Vegetables</h5>
                <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original
                    meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant
                    matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. The alternate definition of
                    the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may
                    exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but
                    include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as
                    pulses.</p>

                <h5 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Fruits</h5>
                <p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have
                    propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed
                    dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a
                    source of food.[1] Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's
                    agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive
                    cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>
